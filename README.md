## [PickUsLunch](https://github.com/NitzanBarzilay/PickUsLunch)
#### AI assistant that helps groups of friends or co-workers find a restaurant to order from together, that best matches the group members' dining preferences.

In this project, we used restaurants menus gathered via Wolt's API and created a smart system that helps groups of friends or co-workers find a single restaurant that matches everyone's needs and preferences (such as vegeterianism, koher, spiciness level etc). We examined several different algorithms (neither are ML-based), all of them provided solutions who were incredibly close to the optimal solution (that could be found by iterating over the entire 30M combinations dataset) in a fraction of the time (up to 11K times faster)!

_Methods used in this AI projects: local search, genetic algorithms._

## [Knesset Topic Classification](https://github.com/NitzanBarzilay/KnessetTopicClassification)
#### An independant multi-phase NLP project for classifying parlemintary quotes in Hebrew into 8 topics. Also includes the annotated dataset. 

In this project, I started with a raw dataset of quotes (in Hebrew) gathered from protocoles of the Knesset (the Israeli parliment). In the first stage of the project, I used unsupervised topic modeling methods in order to cluster quotes by topics. The topic assignment that was created during the first stage were used to prioritize qoutes for manual tagging process - quotes with the highest confidence score were sent to mannual tagging. This process created ~2,700 quotes that were manually tagged into 8 topics (in addition to a "no topic" tag). Then, in the second phase of this project, I trained a supervised classifier to predict quotes topics.

_Methods used in this NLP projects: Topic modeling (unsupervised), Topic classification (supervised)._
